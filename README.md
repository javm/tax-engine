# Bracketed tax calculator

## Run
ruby tax_engine.rb

## Scalation
To scale the program and adapt it to a new bracket scales the following is suggested

1. Write the ranges in a configuration file or array containing the upper range limits for each bracket

2. Parallelize or queueing the process could incrase the performance, having (1) we got an array where we can search a place for our income, I imagine something like insertion sort heuristic. 

3. Expose the server as a web server (socket or REST)
